1. **Backend Functionality:**

    a. **User Authentication and Authorization:**
       - Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access and control the smart home devices. This involves handling user registration, login, and session management securely.

    b. **Device Management:**
       - Develop APIs for registering, managing, and controlling smart home devices. This includes functionalities such as adding new devices, updating device configurations, and sending commands to devices for actions like turning on/off lights or adjusting thermostat settings.

    c. **Schedule Management:**
       - Implement features for users to create and manage schedules for their smart home devices. This involves defining recurring or one-time events, specifying device actions, and handling schedule execution based on predefined time intervals or triggers.

    d. **Real-time Communication:**
       - Set up real-time communication channels (e.g., WebSocket) to enable instant updates and notifications between the server and connected devices. This allows for seamless synchronization of device states and user interactions in real-time.

    e. **Data Logging and Analytics:**
       - Implement logging mechanisms to record user actions, device events, and system status for monitoring and analysis purposes. This data can be used to identify usage patterns, diagnose issues, and optimize system performance over time.

2. **Data Storage:**

    a. **User Data:**
       - Store user information such as usernames, passwords (encrypted), email addresses, and authentication tokens for session management.

    b. **Device Data:**
       - Store device metadata including device IDs, types, names, configurations, and current states (e.g., on/off status, temperature settings).

    c. **Schedule Data:**
       - Store schedule information such as event IDs, associated devices, action types (e.g., turn on, turn off), and timing details (e.g., start time, end time, recurrence pattern).

    d. **Log Data:**
       - Store log entries containing timestamps, user actions, device events, and any relevant metadata for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.
