# Smart Home Automation System

This is a Smart Home Automation System developed using the MEN (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js) stack. The project aims to provide users with a centralized platform to control and manage various smart home devices remotely.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access the system.
- **Device Management:** Register, manage, and control smart home devices such as lights, thermostats, and security cameras.
- **Schedule Management:** Create and manage schedules for automated device control based on predefined time intervals or triggers.
- **Real-time Communication:** Establish real-time communication channels for instant updates and notifications between the server and connected devices.
- **Data Logging and Analytics:** Log user actions, device events, and system status for monitoring, analysis, and optimization purposes.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database used for storing user data, device metadata, schedules, and logs.
- **Express.js:** Web application framework used for building RESTful APIs and handling server-side logic.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side development and real-time communication with devices.
- **WebSocket:** Protocol used for establishing bidirectional communication channels for real-time updates.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Token-based authentication mechanism used for securing API endpoints and managing user sessions.
